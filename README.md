# Collective behavior of Idea Management Communities

Set of R scripts that analyzing four types of user actions in Idea Management communities (i.e., registering as member, posting ideas, commenting, voting) identify individual and collective patterns of behaviors. 

In the analysis, we use machine learning techniques such as unsupervised learning (k-means) to find patterns in the collective behavior of communities.
